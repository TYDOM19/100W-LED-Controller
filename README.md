100W LED Controller
High Power Led Driver (Target Microchip PIC16F886) Using custom control board with low side drive, precision current monitor and tactile switch, the firmware allows the user to select 6 distinct set points. These set points are then used in a custom tuned PI loop to achieve desired target brightness (lumens 10-3000) of (1) 100W or (3) 10W LEDs. As the tactile switch is monitored in the main loop to detect and track 6 states. The PID loop is limited to just proportional and integral control with starting points that help with fast setting between mode switches. An ADC loop is used to monitor current, battery voltage and an RTD to help protect the RC battery and user from harm. The tuning was performed by outputting set point, error, integral at high baud rate to putty to determine the min # of loops required to for control loop to settle. This Kp and Ki values can easily be changed for experimentation. Over Current, Under Voltage, Over Temp conditions are all monitored to prevent runaway or racing conditions. Timers are used for switch depress timing a heartbeat indicator.
